My first manager at the current company was American. One day we were
having dinner with the team. He was saying something in Thai and I was
really impressed by how well he nailed the pronunciation and the tones.
Thai is a tonal language and it has short and long vowels, and multiple
combinations of vowels. I told him his Thai was very good. He thanked
me and said, "like what they said,"

"*Fake it 'til you make it.*"

That was not the first time I heard this phrase, but it was the time
it struck me, maybe because it came at the right time.

As a software engineer, it is easy to compare yourself to others and
find that you are not doing as good. Well, I think that applies to any
profession actually. Comparison is the thief of joy, but it's hard to
not compare.

Sometimes I doubt how am I going to do this or that, but this phrase
keeps reminding me to just *fake it 'til I make it*. Last year,
especially, I was promoted to a senior software engineer. I didn't
know what exactly I should do to be worthy of the *senior* title, but
I kept on pretending—manifesting—to be my imaginary senior software
engineer.

It worked, or at least I believe that it worked.

If you are doubting your ability or maybe you are just trying to be
someone better, try to *fake it 'til you make it*.
